# Neural-inverse-kinematics-training-of-a-robotic-arm-
Through computer simulations we train a neural network to have the inverse kinematics of an arm manufactured from scratch

## Descripton ##
Currently there are a snfin of tools at our fingertips, which make life easier for us. And if we use them in our projects, they help us to advance a little more.
In this case, we use data obtained from a mechanism simulator to train a neural network through the use of colab, to obtain the inverse kinematic of a robotic arm.


## Key concepts covered ##

- Using the free software [linkage](https://blog.rectorsquid.com/linkage-mechanism-designer-and-simulator/), it allows simulating mechanisms and obtaining data on some points.
- Add Wifi [timer Camera M5](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/esp32-psram-timer-camera-fisheye-ov3660) to the arm to view the part.
- Use fiducial to capture the object and calculate how far away it is.
- Create an extensive database to train a neural network in colab.
- Use Tensorflow in python to get the pulses needed for each motor.
